## 📝 Concept table
| Concept              | Description                                                                  | Example Code Snippet                                |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Arrays               | Collections of values stored in a single variable.                           | `$fruits = array("Apple", "Banana");`               |
| While Loop           | Repeats a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.          | `while($x <= 5) { echo $x; $x++; }`                 |
| Do-While Loop        | Executes the block of code once before checking the condition.               | `do { echo $x; $x++; } while ($x <= 5);`            |
| If-Else Statement    | Conditional statement that executes different code based on conditions.      | `if ($time < 12) { echo "Good morning!"; }`         |
| Switch Statement     | Selects one of many blocks of code to execute.                               | `switch ($color) { case "red": echo ... }`          |
